## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive AI Testing and Assurance Framework for use across public sector AI projects. It provides standardised guidance to ensure that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are safe, effective, and trustworthy throughout their lifecycle. The framework aligns with the UK Government’s AI Playbook principles and requirements for ethical and responsible AI use . It is applicable to a wide range of AI technologies – from simple rule-based systems to complex machine learning models, generative AI, and autonomous agentic AI – with tailored approaches for each.

The framework defines key testing and quality assurance (QA) principles for AI, core quality characteristics to evaluate, and a lifecycle-based assurance strategy that integrates testing activities from initial design through deployment and operation. It introduces a modular testing approach with specific test modules that can be selected based on the AI system’s type and risk profile. High-risk AI applications (for example, those impacting public safety or individuals’ rights) are expected to undergo more rigorous testing and oversight than lower-risk uses.

By following this framework, Government teams can increase confidence that their AI systems are reliable, unbiased, explainable, and compliant with applicable standards and legislation. The framework helps project teams plan appropriate testing activities, select relevant metrics and tools, and address ethical risks proactively. Ultimately, it supports the public sector in harnessing AI innovation while safeguarding the public’s trust, rights, and well-being.

## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a unified cross-government framework for testing and assuring AI systems. It provides a common approach and set of standards for testing AI-enabled solutions used in the UK public sector. By defining clear procedures, quality criteria, and governance measures, this framework aims to ensure that all AI systems deployed are thoroughly validated for safety, accuracy, fairness, transparency, security, and other critical quality criteria before and during operation. It translates high-level AI ethics and risk management principles into a practical testing strategy that project teams can follow. Ultimately, the framework’s purpose is to embed consistency and rigor in how the teams build and evaluate AI, such that outcomes are reliable and align with legal and ethical obligations.
### Scope
This framework applies to all stages of the AI solution lifecycle – from initial planning and design through development, testing, deployment, and ongoing monitoring. It is intended for use across UK Government departments, agencies, and other public sector bodies developing or procuring AI systems. The scope covers all types of AI technologies (as detailed in section 2.4) and addresses both technical testing (model performance, data quality, etc.) and governance processes (risk assessments, documentation, approvals).
The framework is project-focused and can be adapted to AI initiatives of varying size and risk. It covers pre-deployment testing (e.g. validating models in controlled environments) as well as post-deployment assurance (e.g. monitoring live systems for drift or issues). The framework is cross-disciplinary, encompassing activities for data scientists, developers,  test engineers, policy and ethics reviewers, information assurance teams, and senior decision-makers. It does not replace specific legal or regulatory requirements, but rather consolidates and references them so that teams can ensure compliance through testing .
### Audience
The intended audience for this document includes all stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, and oversight of AI systems in Government. In particular:
- **Product Managers** — to plan AI projects with appropriate testing phases, risk mitigation, and governance checkpoints.
- **Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers** — to integrate these testing practices into model development, ensuring models meet quality criteria and can be audited.
- **Test Engineers** — to design and execute test cases specific to AI components, including functional and non-functional tests beyond traditional software testing.
- **Policy, Ethics, and Legal Advisors** — to understand how ethical and legal requirements are verified through testing, and to participate in reviews.
- **Senior Responsible Owners and Governance Boards** — to oversee the risk management of AI projects, make go/no-go decisions based on test evidence, and maintain accountability for AI outcomes.
- **Operational Teams and Security** — to carry out monitoring of AI systems in production, respond to incidents, and enforce controls.
- **External Assessors or Auditors** (if applicable) — to provide independent assurance by reviewing evidence from this framework.

### AI Types Covered
This framework is designed to cover a broad range of AI system types, noting that different testing approaches may be needed for each. It explicitly addresses the following categories of AI:

- **Rule-Based or Deterministic AI**: Systems that follow predefined logic or rulesets (e.g. expert systems or automated business rules). These are largely predictable, but assurance focuses on verifying all rules and conditions are correct and complete.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Predictive models trained on data (including supervised, unsupervised, and simple reinforcement learning where applicable). Examples include classification or regression models, neural networks for prediction, etc. Assurance focuses on data quality, accuracy, generalization, and avoidance of bias in these models.

- **Generative AI**: Advanced models that produce content (such as text, images, or audio) - for example, Large Language Models (LLMs) and other Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These models have more open-ended outputs. Assurance emphasizes output appropriateness, factual accuracy, avoidance of harmful content, and controlling unpredictable behavior (including prompt testing for LLMs).

- **Agentic AI (Autonomous Agents)**: AI systems that have a level of autonomy to analyze, decide, and act in an environment with minimal human intervention. This includes adaptive agents that use reinforcement learning or plan multi-step tasks (for example, an AI scheduling agent or a robotic process controller that dynamically learns). They are probabilistic and highly adaptive, which poses unique testing challenges. Assurance for agentic AI focuses on safety of autonomous behaviors, the agent’s ability to handle novel situations, avoidance of ‘reward hacking’ (gaming the specified goals), and ensuring that mechanisms for human override or intervention function properly.

> Because agentic AI can evolve through interactions, continuous monitoring and periodic re-validation are crucial for this type.

For each AI type above, the framework will highlight any specific considerations in the [Modular AI Testing Framework](#modular-ai-testing-framework). Many AI systems are hybrid or complex (for instance, an AI service might include an ML model and a rule-based decision layer together); in such cases, teams should apply all relevant parts of the framework. The overarching approach is risk-based and context-appropriate, meaning that the extent of testing for any AI system should be commensurate with its potential impact and complexity.

## Testing and Quality Assurance Principles for AI

- **Design Context-Appropriate Testing**  
One size does not fit all. Always validate AI systems in conditions that reflect their real-world use context . This means moving beyond idealized training scenarios - for example, testing models on live or representative data to detect concept drift or unusual inputs that differ from training. A rule-based expert system, a predictive ML model, and a generative AI chatbot each require a different assurance focus and test design tailored to their use case and operating environment.

- **Ensure Stability of Autonomous Operation**  
If the AI will operate with any autonomy, evaluate how it behaves during prolonged unattended operation and edge cases . Does it gracefully escalate to human control when needed? Can it recover safely from errors without human intervention? We must specifically test ‘agentic’ aspects: for autonomous/agentic AI, simulate extended runs and unexpected scenarios to ensure the system remains safe and effective without constant oversight.

- **Continuously Test Quality Across Versions**  
Treat AI models as ever-evolving - they may be retrained, updated or refined over time. Establish procedures to retest models whenever they change (new data, new model release, pipeline modifications) . This ongoing testing guards against regressions (performance drops), ethical drift (e.g. a model becoming less fair over time), or other quality degradation. Continuously incorporate feedback from real-world use to improve both the AI and the assurance measures (learning from incidents, updating tests, etc.).

- **Adopt a Risk-Based Approach**  
The rigor of testing should be proportional to the AI system’s risk and impact . Not all AI deployments carry the same weight – a typo-correcting AI assistant is not as critical as an AI diagnosing medical conditions. Perform an initial risk classification (considering factors like impact on legal rights, safety, scale of use, novelty of the tech) and let that guide the depth of assurance. High-risk AI (e.g. those that could endanger lives or cause legal determinations about individuals) demand exhaustive testing – possibly including formal verification or external audits – before deployment . Lower-risk tools can use lighter-weight checks, though still covering all relevant quality dimensions. Under this framework, no AI system is deployed without adequate testing, but the notion of 'proportionality' ensures resources are focused where it matters most.

- **Make AI Decisions Transparent and Understandable**
Ensure the AI’s workings can be explained and interpreted by humans to an appropriate degree . This means investing in explainability techniques: for ML, use tools to highlight which factors influenced specific predictions; for rule-based systems, maintain clear logic documentation; for generative or agentic AI, provide context or summaries of how they operate. In testing, verify that these explanations are accurate and helpful. This principle supports transparency obligations such as providing meaningful information about automated decisions under GDPR.

- **Treat Ethics as Testable Risk**
Ethical considerations (e.g. avoiding harm, respecting rights, non-discrimination) should be managed like any other risk - with explicit tests and controls. Define ethical risk scenarios (such as the AI producing harmful or offensive output, or unfairly denying a service) and include them in test plans . Trace these back to design: ensure the system’s goals, training data, and constraints align with ethical guidelines. If there are defined ethical standards or checklists, treat compliance with those as test requirements.

- **Test for Unintended Behaviors**
Perform adversarial and stress testing to uncover how the AI behaves in extreme or unanticipated situations . This can reveal ‘unknown unknowns' - for example, a vision model picking up a spurious pattern (shortcut) or a chatbot getting tricked into revealing confidential info. Simulate malicious inputs, weird edge-case data, or reward hacking attempts to see if the AI can be pushed into undesired actions . This proactive probing helps identify vulnerabilities before real adversaries or incidents exploit them.

- **Design for Safe and Predictable Failure**
Verify that if the AI system does fail or encounter abnormal conditions, it fails safely . Testing should include scenarios of component outages, bad data, or exceptions to ensure the system responds with appropriate fallbacks (e.g. default to a conservative decision or hand off to a human) rather than uncontrolled behavior. In other words, build and test fail-safe mechanisms (or ‘graceful degradation’) so that failures do not lead to harm or chaos.

- **Benchmark Performance Holistically**
Test not only accuracy, but also the system’s efficiency, scalability, and resilience under load . Measure response times, throughput under peak usage, and resource utilization (CPU, memory, etc.), especially for large models or real-time systems. Evaluate performance under degraded conditions too (e.g. network latency, partial outages) to ensure service continuity. Holistic performance testing ensures the AI can meet service level requirements in a production environment, not just produce correct output in ideal lab conditions.

- **Make AI Behavior Observable**
Implement monitoring hooks and telemetry to observe the AI in action . In testing and in production, we should track things like model confidence scores, input distributions, and output trends so that anomalies can be detected quickly. For example, if a model’s predictions start drifting from expected patterns, monitoring should trigger an alert. This observability principle ties into deployment - ensuring there are tools (dashboards, logs) to continually watch the ‘health’ of the AI system.

These principles set the tone for the subsequent sections. They encourage testers and project teams to look at AI quality from multiple angles - technical, ethical, and operational - and to integrate assurance as a continuous effort. 

## Core AI Quality Attributes for Testing

A cornerstone of this framework is understanding what quality means for AI systems. We define a set of Core Quality Characteristics that an AI system should be evaluated against. Each characteristic is accompanied by a definition and the specific testing focus needed to assure that quality attribute in an AI context. Table below summarizes the core quality characteristics, which form a quality matrix that teams can use to plan tests and measures:

| Quality Attribute | Description                                      | Example Test Focus                              |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Functional Suitability| Degree to which the AI fulfills its specified tasks and objectives.| Validate the AI outputs against requirements: e.g. check predictions or decisions for correctness and alignment with the intended functionality. Each rule (in rule-based systems) or each output category (in ML) should be tested to ensure expected behavior. |
| Performance Efficiency| Speed, responsiveness, and resource usage of the AI system.| Measure inference time per transaction, throughput under load, and resource consumption (CPU, GPU, memory). Test that the model or system meets performance SLAs (e.g. response within X ms) and scales to expected user volumes.|
| Compatibility| The ability of the AI system to operate in different environments, configurations, or to integrate with other systems.|Test the AI in varied runtime environments (different operating systems, hardware, cloud vs on-prem) and with other software components (APIs, databases). Ensure input/output formats are compatible and the AI component does not break existing interfaces.|
| Usability | The ease with which users (human operators or end-users) can interact with and benefit from the AI. |Evaluate the user interface or interaction design around the AI: for example, clarity of a chatbot’s responses, interpretability of an AI decision support tool’s output, and user guidance or error messages. Include user experience (UX) testing sessions and accessibility reviews.|
| Reliability| The consistency and stability of the AI system’s performance over time and under varying conditions.| Test for stability under stress and over extended periods. For instance, run the model through long sequences of inputs to see if it crashes or degrades. Check output consistency: does the AI produce similar results for similar inputs? Introduce fault conditions (like intermittent network or sensor failures for an AI IoT device) to see if the system recovers gracefully (no uncontrolled failures).|
| Security | Protection against unauthorized access, misuse, or adversarial attacks on the AI system or its data.| Perform security testing, including penetration tests on AI APIs, checks for data leakage (does the model inadvertently reveal sensitive training data?), and adversarial attack simulations (e.g. for an image classifier, try adversarial pixel perturbations to see if it can be fooled ). Ensure proper authentication/authorization around the AI service.|
| Maintainability| How easily the AI system (especially the model) can be maintained, updated, or fixed over time.| Verify that the code and model training process are well-documented and version-controlled. Test the process of retraining or updating the model: can it be done without introducing errors? Also, check modularity of the system (can components be replaced or improved in isolation?).|
| Portability| The ability to transfer the AI system across different platforms or adapt it to work in new contexts.| If relevant, test deploying the model on different platforms (e.g. from a developer’s environment to the cloud, or from cloud to an edge device). Ensure dependencies are documented and containerization or virtualization works. For ML models, test that they can be re-trained or fine-tuned on new data domains (if portability extends to adapting to new tasks).|
| Adaptability| The AIs ability to adjust its behavior in response to changes in its environment or requirements.| This often applies to online learning systems or configurable AI. Testing involves simulating environmental changes (new data patterns, concept drift) and verifying the system still functions correctly and meets NFRs after adapting . Check how quickly the AI adapts (latency of adaptation) and resources used during adaptation.|
| Autonomy| Degree to which the AI can operate independently of human intervention. (Relevant for agentic or autonomous AI systems.)| Challenge the system outside its normal operating envelope to test its autonomy limits . For example, what happens if an autonomous agent encounters a scenario not covered in training? Does it request human help appropriately? Test any 'human override' triggers , the AI should know when to stop and defer to humans if certain risk thresholds are exceeded.|
| Evolution (Learning Capability)| The capability of the AI to learn and improve from experience over time (if applicable).| If the system has an online learning component or periodic retraining, validate that learning improves performance without breaking existing functionality. Test for concept drift handling : feed the system data that gradually shifts in distribution and see if performance remains acceptable or if drift is detected. Also ensure mechanisms exist to detect when the AIs evolving behavior might diverge from policy (ethical drift).|
| Transparency| The degree to which the AI’s workings, data, and logic are visible and understandable to stakeholders.|Check that the system produces audit logs or traceability of its decisions (e.g. which rules fired, or how a conclusion was reached). Ensure documentation like model cards or algorithmic transparency records are produced. A test in this context might be: given a specific decision the AI made, can we trace back to the input data and the steps that led to it? If using the ATRS, verify that the transparency record is complete and published .|
| Explainability| The ability to explain or articulate the reasoning behind the AI’s outputs in human-understandable terms.| Apply explainability methods and evaluate them. For ML, use tools (e.g. SHAP, LIME) on sample outputs to generate feature importance or explanations . Then have domain experts review these explanations to see if they 'make sense' (e.g. are the important factors clinically relevant in a medical AI?). For rule-based systems, verify that each rule has an associated explanation, and that the system can generate a rationale trace (e.g. 'Application rejected because income below threshold and credit score low'). The testing focus is on fidelity of explanations (they should accurately reflect the true logic) and user comprehension (explanations should be understandable to the target audience).|
| Freedom from Bias (Fairness)| The mitigation of unwanted bias – the AI’s outputs should be fair and not unjustifiably discriminate against any group or factor.| Conduct thorough bias audits: run the AI on test datasets stratified by sensitive attributes (like gender, ethnicity, age, etc.) and compare outcomes . Compute fairness metrics (e.g. difference in acceptance rates between groups, disparate error rates). Also test for data bias: e.g. use external datasets or synthetic data to check if the model has a skew. If biases are found, ensure mitigation steps are tested (such as retraining with balanced data or applying post-processing corrections). Verify compliance with Equality Act 2010 and PSED – public sector bodies must show they have considered and minimized discrimination in AI .|
| Side Effects & Reward Hacking| The presence of unintended behaviors arising from the AI’s optimization process (especially in agentic or goal-driven AI).| Attempt to identify and trigger any potential side effects of the AI’s objectives . For example, in a reinforcement learning agent, see if it finds a shortcut that technically maximizes reward but is undesired (reward hacking). Create test scenarios where the straightforward way to achieve the goal is blocked, and see if the agent resorts to an unacceptable strategy. Evaluating this might involve simulation testing and anomaly detection on the agent’s behaviors.|
| Ethical Compliance| Alignment with ethical guidelines, values, and laws (beyond bias alone) – e.g. ensuring the AI respects privacy, dignity, and does not produce harmful content.| Use an ethical checklist or assessment (for example, the EU’s Trustworthy AI Assessment List or a similar UK government ethics framework) and verify each point. Test cases might include: does the AI avoid producing disallowed content (toxicity tests for a chatbot)? Does it respect privacy (no personal data leaked; conforms to data minimization)? Involve an ethics review panel to examine outcomes. Pass/fail criteria should be established for ethical requirements (even if qualitative).|
| Safety| The ability of the AI system to not cause harm to life, property, or the environment – particularly relevant for physical robots or decision-making in high-stakes domains.| Conduct worst-case scenario testing: identify what the most harmful possible outputs or errors could be (e.g. a medical AI misdiagnosis, or an autonomous vehicle control failure) and test with scenarios around those extremes . Validate any safety mechanisms (like emergency stop for a robot, or human review for certain high-risk decisions). If standards exist (e.g. functional safety standards for AI in automotive), ensure tests cover those criteria. Safety testing often overlaps with robustness and ethical testing but focuses on preventing harm.|
