## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive AI Testing and Assurance Framework for use across public sector AI projects. It provides standardised guidance to ensure that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are safe, effective, and trustworthy throughout their lifecycle. The framework aligns with the UK Government’s AI Playbook principles and requirements for ethical and responsible AI use . It is applicable to a wide range of AI technologies – from simple rule-based systems to complex machine learning models, generative AI, and autonomous agentic AI – with tailored approaches for each.

The framework defines key testing and quality assurance (QA) principles for AI, core quality characteristics to evaluate, and a lifecycle-based assurance strategy that integrates testing activities from initial design through deployment and operation. It introduces a modular testing approach with specific test modules that can be selected based on the AI system’s type and risk profile. High-risk AI applications (for example, those impacting public safety or individuals’ rights) are expected to undergo more rigorous testing and oversight than lower-risk uses.

By following this framework, Government teams can increase confidence that their AI systems are reliable, unbiased, explainable, and compliant with applicable standards and legislation. The framework helps project teams plan appropriate testing activities, select relevant metrics and tools, and address ethical risks proactively. Ultimately, it supports the public sector in harnessing AI innovation while safeguarding the public’s trust, rights, and well-being.

## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a unified cross-government framework for testing and assuring AI systems. It provides a common approach and set of standards for testing AI-enabled solutions used in the UK public sector. By defining clear procedures, quality criteria, and governance measures, this framework aims to ensure that all AI systems deployed are thoroughly validated for safety, accuracy, fairness, transparency, security, and other critical quality criteria before and during operation. It translates high-level AI ethics and risk management principles into a practical testing strategy that project teams can follow. Ultimately, the framework’s purpose is to embed consistency and rigor in how the teams build and evaluate AI, such that outcomes are reliable and align with legal and ethical obligations.
### Scope
This framework applies to all stages of the AI solution lifecycle – from initial planning and design through development, testing, deployment, and ongoing monitoring. It is intended for use across UK Government departments, agencies, and other public sector bodies developing or procuring AI systems. The scope covers all types of AI technologies (as detailed in section 2.4) and addresses both technical testing (model performance, data quality, etc.) and governance processes (risk assessments, documentation, approvals).
The framework is project-focused and can be adapted to AI initiatives of varying size and risk. It covers pre-deployment testing (e.g. validating models in controlled environments) as well as post-deployment assurance (e.g. monitoring live systems for drift or issues). The framework is cross-disciplinary, encompassing activities for data scientists, developers,  test engineers, policy and ethics reviewers, information assurance teams, and senior decision-makers. It does not replace specific legal or regulatory requirements, but rather consolidates and references them so that teams can ensure compliance through testing .
### Audience
The intended audience for this document includes all stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, and oversight of AI systems in Government. In particular:
- **Product Managers** — to plan AI projects with appropriate testing phases, risk mitigation, and governance checkpoints.
- **Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers** — to integrate these testing practices into model development, ensuring models meet quality criteria and can be audited.
- **Test Engineers** — to design and execute test cases specific to AI components, including functional and non-functional tests beyond traditional software testing.
- **Policy, Ethics, and Legal Advisors** — to understand how ethical and legal requirements are verified through testing, and to participate in reviews.
- **Senior Responsible Owners and Governance Boards** — to oversee the risk management of AI projects, make go/no-go decisions based on test evidence, and maintain accountability for AI outcomes.
- **Operational Teams and Security** — to carry out monitoring of AI systems in production, respond to incidents, and enforce controls.
- **External Assessors or Auditors** (if applicable) — to provide independent assurance by reviewing evidence from this framework.

### AI Types Covered
This framework is designed to cover a broad range of AI system types, noting that different testing approaches may be needed for each. It explicitly addresses the following categories of AI:

- **Rule-Based or Deterministic AI**: Systems that follow predefined logic or rulesets (e.g. expert systems or automated business rules). These are largely predictable, but assurance focuses on verifying all rules and conditions are correct and complete.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Predictive models trained on data (including supervised, unsupervised, and simple reinforcement learning where applicable). Examples include classification or regression models, neural networks for prediction, etc. Assurance focuses on data quality, accuracy, generalization, and avoidance of bias in these models.

- **Generative AI**: Advanced models that produce content (such as text, images, or audio) - for example, Large Language Models (LLMs) and other Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These models have more open-ended outputs. Assurance emphasizes output appropriateness, factual accuracy, avoidance of harmful content, and controlling unpredictable behavior (including prompt testing for LLMs).

- **Agentic AI (Autonomous Agents)**: AI systems that have a level of autonomy to analyze, decide, and act in an environment with minimal human intervention. This includes adaptive agents that use reinforcement learning or plan multi-step tasks (for example, an AI scheduling agent or a robotic process controller that dynamically learns). They are probabilistic and highly adaptive, which poses unique testing challenges. Assurance for agentic AI focuses on safety of autonomous behaviors, the agent’s ability to handle novel situations, avoidance of ‘reward hacking’ (gaming the specified goals), and ensuring that mechanisms for human override or intervention function properly.

> Because agentic AI can evolve through interactions, continuous monitoring and periodic re-validation are crucial for this type.

For each AI type above, the framework will highlight any specific considerations in the [Modular AI Testing Framework](#modular-ai-testing-framework). Many AI systems are hybrid or complex (for instance, an AI service might include an ML model and a rule-based decision layer together); in such cases, teams should apply all relevant parts of the framework. The overarching approach is risk-based and context-appropriate, meaning that the extent of testing for any AI system should be commensurate with its potential impact and complexity.

## Testing and Quality Assurance Principles for AI

- **Design Context-Appropriate Testing**  
One size does not fit all. Always validate AI systems in conditions that reflect their real-world use context . This means moving beyond idealized training scenarios - for example, testing models on live or representative data to detect concept drift or unusual inputs that differ from training. A rule-based expert system, a predictive ML model, and a generative AI chatbot each require a different assurance focus and test design tailored to their use case and operating environment.

- **Ensure Stability of Autonomous Operation**  
If the AI will operate with any autonomy, evaluate how it behaves during prolonged unattended operation and edge cases . Does it gracefully escalate to human control when needed? Can it recover safely from errors without human intervention? We must specifically test ‘agentic’ aspects: for autonomous/agentic AI, simulate extended runs and unexpected scenarios to ensure the system remains safe and effective without constant oversight.

- **Continuously Test Quality Across Versions**  
Treat AI models as ever-evolving - they may be retrained, updated or refined over time. Establish procedures to retest models whenever they change (new data, new model release, pipeline modifications) . This ongoing testing guards against regressions (performance drops), ethical drift (e.g. a model becoming less fair over time), or other quality degradation. Continuously incorporate feedback from real-world use to improve both the AI and the assurance measures (learning from incidents, updating tests, etc.).

- **Adopt a Risk-Based Approach**  
The rigor of testing should be proportional to the AI system’s risk and impact . Not all AI deployments carry the same weight – a typo-correcting AI assistant is not as critical as an AI diagnosing medical conditions. Perform an initial risk classification (considering factors like impact on legal rights, safety, scale of use, novelty of the tech) and let that guide the depth of assurance. High-risk AI (e.g. those that could endanger lives or cause legal determinations about individuals) demand exhaustive testing – possibly including formal verification or external audits – before deployment . Lower-risk tools can use lighter-weight checks, though still covering all relevant quality dimensions. Under this framework, no AI system is deployed without adequate testing, but the notion of 'proportionality' ensures resources are focused where it matters most.

- **Make AI Decisions Transparent and Understandable**    
Ensure the AI’s workings can be explained and interpreted by humans to an appropriate degree . This means investing in explainability techniques: for ML, use tools to highlight which factors influenced specific predictions; for rule-based systems, maintain clear logic documentation; for generative or agentic AI, provide context or summaries of how they operate. In testing, verify that these explanations are accurate and helpful. This principle supports transparency obligations such as providing meaningful information about automated decisions under GDPR.

- **Treat Ethics as Testable Risk**    
Ethical considerations (e.g. avoiding harm, respecting rights, non-discrimination) should be managed like any other risk - with explicit tests and controls. Define ethical risk scenarios (such as the AI producing harmful or offensive output, or unfairly denying a service) and include them in test plans . Trace these back to design: ensure the system’s goals, training data, and constraints align with ethical guidelines. If there are defined ethical standards or checklists, treat compliance with those as test requirements.

- **Test for Unintended Behaviors**    
Perform adversarial and stress testing to uncover how the AI behaves in extreme or unanticipated situations . This can reveal ‘unknown unknowns' - for example, a vision model picking up a spurious pattern (shortcut) or a chatbot getting tricked into revealing confidential info. Simulate malicious inputs, weird edge-case data, or reward hacking attempts to see if the AI can be pushed into undesired actions . This proactive probing helps identify vulnerabilities before real adversaries or incidents exploit them.

- **Design for Safe and Predictable Failure**   
Verify that if the AI system does fail or encounter abnormal conditions, it fails safely . Testing should include scenarios of component outages, bad data, or exceptions to ensure the system responds with appropriate fallbacks (e.g. default to a conservative decision or hand off to a human) rather than uncontrolled behavior. In other words, build and test fail-safe mechanisms (or ‘graceful degradation’) so that failures do not lead to harm or chaos.

- **Benchmark Performance Holistically**  
Test not only accuracy, but also the system’s efficiency, scalability, and resilience under load . Measure response times, throughput under peak usage, and resource utilization (CPU, memory, etc.), especially for large models or real-time systems. Evaluate performance under degraded conditions too (e.g. network latency, partial outages) to ensure service continuity. Holistic performance testing ensures the AI can meet service level requirements in a production environment, not just produce correct output in ideal lab conditions.

- **Make AI Behavior Observable**   
Implement monitoring hooks and telemetry to observe the AI in action . In testing and in production, we should track things like model confidence scores, input distributions, and output trends so that anomalies can be detected quickly. For example, if a model’s predictions start drifting from expected patterns, monitoring should trigger an alert. This observability principle ties into deployment - ensuring there are tools (dashboards, logs) to continually watch the ‘health’ of the AI system.

These principles set the tone for the subsequent sections. They encourage testers and project teams to look at AI quality from multiple angles - technical, ethical, and operational - and to integrate assurance as a continuous effort. 

## Core AI Quality Attributes for Testing

A cornerstone of this framework is understanding what quality means for AI systems. We define a set of Core Quality Characteristics that an AI system should be evaluated against. Each characteristic is accompanied by a definition and the specific testing focus needed to assure that quality attribute in an AI context. Table below summarizes the core quality characteristics, which form a quality matrix that teams can use to plan tests and measures:

| Quality Attribute | Description                                      |  Test Focus                              |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Functional Suitability| Degree to which the AI fulfills its specified tasks and objectives.| Validate the AI outputs against requirements: e.g. check predictions or decisions for correctness and alignment with the intended functionality. Each rule (in rule-based systems) or each output category (in ML) should be tested to ensure expected behavior. |
| Performance Efficiency| Speed, responsiveness, and resource usage of the AI system.| Measure inference time per transaction, throughput under load, and resource consumption (CPU, GPU, memory). Test that the model or system meets performance SLAs (e.g. response within X ms) and scales to expected user volumes.|
| Compatibility| The ability of the AI system to operate in different environments, configurations, or to integrate with other systems.|Test the AI in varied runtime environments (different operating systems, hardware, cloud vs on-prem) and with other software components (APIs, databases). Ensure input/output formats are compatible and the AI component does not break existing interfaces.|
| Usability | The ease with which users (human operators or end-users) can interact with and benefit from the AI. |Evaluate the user interface or interaction design around the AI: for example, clarity of a chatbot’s responses, interpretability of an AI decision support tool’s output, and user guidance or error messages. Include user experience (UX) testing sessions and accessibility reviews.|
| Reliability| The consistency and stability of the AI system’s performance over time and under varying conditions.| Test for stability under stress and over extended periods. For instance, run the model through long sequences of inputs to see if it crashes or degrades. Check output consistency: does the AI produce similar results for similar inputs? Introduce fault conditions (like intermittent network or sensor failures for an AI IoT device) to see if the system recovers gracefully (no uncontrolled failures).|
| Security | Protection against unauthorized access, misuse, or adversarial attacks on the AI system or its data.| Perform security testing, including penetration tests on AI APIs, checks for data leakage (does the model inadvertently reveal sensitive training data?), and adversarial attack simulations (e.g. for an image classifier, try adversarial pixel perturbations to see if it can be fooled ). Ensure proper authentication/authorization around the AI service.|
| Maintainability| How easily the AI system (especially the model) can be maintained, updated, or fixed over time.| Verify that the code and model training process are well-documented and version-controlled. Test the process of retraining or updating the model: can it be done without introducing errors? Also, check modularity of the system (can components be replaced or improved in isolation?).|
| Portability| The ability to transfer the AI system across different platforms or adapt it to work in new contexts.| If relevant, test deploying the model on different platforms (e.g. from a developer’s environment to the cloud, or from cloud to an edge device). Ensure dependencies are documented and containerization or virtualization works. For ML models, test that they can be re-trained or fine-tuned on new data domains (if portability extends to adapting to new tasks).|
| Adaptability| The AIs ability to adjust its behavior in response to changes in its environment or requirements.| This often applies to online learning systems or configurable AI. Testing involves simulating environmental changes (new data patterns, concept drift) and verifying the system still functions correctly and meets NFRs after adapting . Check how quickly the AI adapts (latency of adaptation) and resources used during adaptation.|
| Autonomy| Degree to which the AI can operate independently of human intervention. (Relevant for agentic or autonomous AI systems.)| Challenge the system outside its normal operating envelope to test its autonomy limits . For example, what happens if an autonomous agent encounters a scenario not covered in training? Does it request human help appropriately? Test any 'human override' triggers , the AI should know when to stop and defer to humans if certain risk thresholds are exceeded.|
| Evolution (Learning Capability)| The capability of the AI to learn and improve from experience over time (if applicable).| If the system has an online learning component or periodic retraining, validate that learning improves performance without breaking existing functionality. Test for concept drift handling : feed the system data that gradually shifts in distribution and see if performance remains acceptable or if drift is detected. Also ensure mechanisms exist to detect when the AIs evolving behavior might diverge from policy (ethical drift).|
| Transparency| The degree to which the AI’s workings, data, and logic are visible and understandable to stakeholders.|Check that the system produces audit logs or traceability of its decisions (e.g. which rules fired, or how a conclusion was reached). Ensure documentation like model cards or algorithmic transparency records are produced. A test in this context might be: given a specific decision the AI made, can we trace back to the input data and the steps that led to it? If using the ATRS, verify that the transparency record is complete and published .|
| Explainability| The ability to explain or articulate the reasoning behind the AI’s outputs in human-understandable terms.| Apply explainability methods and evaluate them. For ML, use tools (e.g. SHAP, LIME) on sample outputs to generate feature importance or explanations . Then have domain experts review these explanations to see if they 'make sense' (e.g. are the important factors clinically relevant in a medical AI?). For rule-based systems, verify that each rule has an associated explanation, and that the system can generate a rationale trace (e.g. 'Application rejected because income below threshold and credit score low'). The testing focus is on fidelity of explanations (they should accurately reflect the true logic) and user comprehension (explanations should be understandable to the target audience).|
| Freedom from Bias (Fairness)| The mitigation of unwanted bias – the AI’s outputs should be fair and not unjustifiably discriminate against any group or factor.| Conduct thorough bias audits: run the AI on test datasets stratified by sensitive attributes (like gender, ethnicity, age, etc.) and compare outcomes . Compute fairness metrics (e.g. difference in acceptance rates between groups, disparate error rates). Also test for data bias: e.g. use external datasets or synthetic data to check if the model has a skew. If biases are found, ensure mitigation steps are tested (such as retraining with balanced data or applying post-processing corrections). Verify compliance with Equality Act 2010 and PSED – public sector bodies must show they have considered and minimized discrimination in AI .|
| Side Effects & Reward Hacking| The presence of unintended behaviors arising from the AI’s optimization process (especially in agentic or goal-driven AI).| Attempt to identify and trigger any potential side effects of the AI’s objectives . For example, in a reinforcement learning agent, see if it finds a shortcut that technically maximizes reward but is undesired (reward hacking). Create test scenarios where the straightforward way to achieve the goal is blocked, and see if the agent resorts to an unacceptable strategy. Evaluating this might involve simulation testing and anomaly detection on the agent’s behaviors.|
| Ethical Compliance| Alignment with ethical guidelines, values, and laws (beyond bias alone) – e.g. ensuring the AI respects privacy, dignity, and does not produce harmful content.| Use an ethical checklist or assessment (for example, the EU’s Trustworthy AI Assessment List or a similar UK government ethics framework) and verify each point. Test cases might include: does the AI avoid producing disallowed content (toxicity tests for a chatbot)? Does it respect privacy (no personal data leaked; conforms to data minimization)? Involve an ethics review panel to examine outcomes. Pass/fail criteria should be established for ethical requirements (even if qualitative).|
| Safety| The ability of the AI system to not cause harm to life, property, or the environment – particularly relevant for physical robots or decision-making in high-stakes domains.| Conduct worst-case scenario testing: identify what the most harmful possible outputs or errors could be (e.g. a medical AI misdiagnosis, or an autonomous vehicle control failure) and test with scenarios around those extremes . Validate any safety mechanisms (like emergency stop for a robot, or human review for certain high-risk decisions). If standards exist (e.g. functional safety standards for AI in automotive), ensure tests cover those criteria. Safety testing often overlaps with robustness and ethical testing but focuses on preventing harm.|

## Lifecycle based Testing and Assurance

Assuring an AI system’s quality is not a one-time event - it must be woven through the entire AI development lifecycle. In this framework, we adopt a lifecycle-based strategy, identifying key assurance activities and deliverables at each phase of an AI project. The lifecycle is broken into stages from conception to operation, with each stage having specific goals, risk considerations, and recommended metrics to track. Below provides an overview of each phase, what the testing/assurance focus is, and examples of metrics or outcomes to measure:
### Planning & Design
**Focus**    
At the very start of the project, the emphasis is on setting the stage for quality. This includes defining clear objectives for the AI system, specifying requirements (functional and non-functional), and identifying potential risks. Key activities in this phase are performing Risk Assessments and Impact Assessments - e.g. a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) if personal data is involved, and an Algorithmic Impact Assessment to consider societal impact. The project team should also define what success looks like in measurable terms (for example, ‘predictive accuracy must exceed 90% on benchmark X’ or ‘no disparate impact greater than Y between groups’). Additionally, governance structures are established here: decide on roles (who is accountable for the AI’s outcomes), form an oversight or ethics committee if needed, and outline an initial test strategy. In short, Planning & Design lays out the ‘quality plan’ for the AI.

**Example Outputs/Metrics**   
- Risk Identification: — Number of high-risk items identified in the initial risk assessment (e.g. if 5 major ethical risks are logged, they will need mitigation plans). A completed risk register or heatmap is an output .
- Impact Assessment Score: — If using an impact assessment framework (e.g. scoring for societal impact), record the outcome (e.g. a score indicating medium impact with mitigation, or a summary of the impact assessment’s findings such as ‘minimal privacy impact’ or ‘significant equality implications’).
- Defined Performance Targets: - Document the target values for key performance metrics of the model (e.g. required precision/recall, maximum acceptable error rate, response time). This serves as the benchmark criteria for later testing.
- Compliance Checklist Initiation: - Note any legal/ethical requirements the project must comply with and include these in the project plan.
### Data Collection & Preparation
**Focus**   
In this phase, the team is concerned with gathering, generating, or selecting the data that will be used to train or inform the AI model, and preparing that data for use. Data quality testing is paramount here . This involves verifying that the data is accurate, complete, and representative of the domain. If the dataset is large, use statistical profiling to check for anomalies or gaps. Important considerations include handling missing values, correcting errors or outliers, and ensuring the data covers all relevant scenarios and sub-populations (to avoid biases). The team should also address any biases detected in the dataset - for instance, if certain demographic groups are underrepresented or outcomes are skewed, they may collect additional data or apply balancing techniques. Privacy and compliance steps happen here as well: confirm that using the data is lawful (consent, if required, is obtained; personal data is minimized or anonymized per UK GDPR). By the end of this phase, the training (and testing) datasets should be of known quality and documented.

**Example Outputs/Metrics**   
- Data Quality Metrics: - Quantitative measures such as the percentage of missing or incomplete values in the dataset (e.g. ‘2% of records have missing age field’), error rates in labels (perhaps found via manual spot checks or data cleaning scripts), or consistency scores if applicable (like schema validation pass rate). For example: 95% of records passed all validation checks; 5% had minor formatting issues corrected.
- Bias Indicators: - Any computed metrics that reveal dataset bias, such as class imbalance ratios (e.g. one class constitutes 80% of data), or demographic parity in the dataset (e.g. ‘male:female ratio = 70:30 in training data’). These indicators might be compared to real-world distributions or desired equity levels . If thresholds were set (say, no group should be <15% of data), note whether the dataset meets them or what adjustments were made.
- Coverage of Scenarios: - A qualitative or quantitative assessment of how well the data covers expected use cases. For example: a checklist of scenarios with data counts – ‘Contains data for all 10 regions of the UK; includes examples of all major categories of inquiries from last year’s records; synthetic data added for rare but critical scenario X’. This ensures that the model won’t be blindsided by a common scenario that was absent in training.
- Data Lineage & Documentation: - Although not a metric per se, an output here is documentation (could be a Data Factsheet or datasheet for dataset) capturing where data came from, how it was processed, any assumptions or filtering applied, and any known limitations of the dataset.
### Model Development & Training
**Focus**   
In this phase, the AI model (or ruleset, in a rules-based system) is developed. For machine learning, this involves selecting an appropriate model architecture or algorithm, training the model on the prepared dataset, and tuning hyperparameters to meet the performance goals. Assurance during model development is about validating that the model is learning correctly and is on track to meet requirements . Key tasks include holding out a validation dataset to check performance on unseen data (to detect overfitting), performing cross-validation, and monitoring training metrics (loss curves, etc.). It’s also the stage to infuse fairness and explainability proactively: for example, the team might choose a more interpretable model if transparency is paramount, or apply techniques (like reweighting data) during training to reduce bias if the initial evaluation shows skew. By the end of this phase, there should be a trained model candidate that meets the initial performance criteria on validation data and has evidence of being free from major flaws.

**Example Outputs/Metrics**   
- Model Performance on Validation Data: - Typical metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision/recall, RMSE (for regression), etc., evaluated on a hold-out validation set . For instance: ‘Validation accuracy = 92%, exceeding the 90% target; F1 = 0.88 for class A vs 0.85 for class B’. These results indicate how well the model generalises. Also track metrics across multiple validation splits (k-fold cross-validation) – e.g. ‘Std. deviation of accuracy across 5 folds = 1.2%’ to gauge stability .
- Fairness Metrics (on Validation): - Calculate any relevant fairness statistics on the model’s validation predictions . For example: ‘False negative rate for group X = 5%, for group Y = 9% (disparity of 4%)’ or ‘Calibration between demographics is within 2%’. If these are out of acceptable range, note any mitigation integrated (e.g. adjusted threshold or retrained with balanced data).
- Overfitting Indicators: - Metrics or observations that ensure the model is not memorizing training data. For example, compare training vs validation performance (if training accuracy is 99% but validation 85%, that’s an overfitting red flag). Or use techniques like ‘validation curve’ to see if performance plateaus. An output could be: ‘No overfitting observed - training and validation loss curves converged, with validation performance within 1% of training’.
- Model Documentation: - At this stage, a model description or design document is often produced, capturing architecture, feature inputs, and justification for choices. It might also include initial explainability analysis – e.g. feature importance from the model if available (like ‘Feature X accounted for 40% of decision importance in a tree model’) to verify it aligns with expectations (domain experts might check that and say it makes sense or not). This documentation is important for later explainability and transparency requirements.
### Validation & Verification (Testing Phase)
**Focus**   
Now the model (and any surrounding system components) undergoes rigorous testing in a pre-deployment environment. This phase is essentially the classic testing phase. The AI system is tested against a wide array of scenarios and quality criteria, many of which are detailed in Section 6’s modules. Activities include: functional testing (does the AI do what it’s supposed to, across various cases?), performance testing (does it meet speed and throughput requirements consistently?), stress testing and adversarial testing (throw extreme or malicious cases at it), and user testing (pilot groups interacting with the AI to gather feedback). Verification also means checking that all requirements set in earlier phases have been met - essentially a final validation on the model and system. For high-risk applications, this phase might involve a formal acceptance test witnessed by stakeholders or even external auditors. By the end of Validation & Verification, the team should have high confidence (with evidence) that the AI system is ready for real-world use, or identify issues that need fixing before it can proceed. 

**Example Outputs/Metrics**   
- Test Coverage: - A metric indicating how much of the AI system’s logic has been tested . For rule-based systems, this might be the percentage of rules executed at least once in tests. For ML, it could be coverage of input space or scenarios (e.g. ‘100% of requirement-specified scenarios tested, 85% of identified edge cases tested’). High coverage lends confidence that most behaviors have been vetted.
- Test Results by Quality Characteristic: - A summary status of how the system performed with respect to each quality attribute (from Section 4). For instance: ‘Functional accuracy: passed (met 90% accuracy target). Performance: passed (avg response 800ms < 1s requirement). Reliability: passed (no crashes in 24h test). - Security: - 2 vulnerabilities found (SQL injection bug on input API – needs fix). Fairness: passed after mitigation (no significant disparity >3%)’. This can be presented as a checklist or table – effectively a scorecard across the quality dimensions .
- User Feedback (Pilot/UAT): - If a pilot user group or user acceptance testing (UAT) was conducted (which is recommended especially for tools with user interfaces), collect their feedback quantitatively. E.g. ‘In UAT, 90% of users were able to complete the task with the AI’s assistance without errors; average satisfaction rating 4.2/5'. Also capture qualitative issues (like ‘users found explanations confusing in 3 out of 10 cases’). This informs last-mile improvements.
- Bug and Issue Counts: - The number of defects found during this testing phase, often categorized by severity. For example: ‘5 critical issues (must fix), 12 minor issues logged’. And ideally, by the end, all critical issues are resolved or have acceptable workarounds. Particularly important are any ethical or safety issues discovered – these must be addressed or explicitly accepted by governance if not fixable.
- Go/No-Go Recommendation: - Usually a testing phase ends with a formal test report. A key outcome is a recommendation on whether the system is fit for deployment. This is often phrased as: ‘Proceed to deployment’ or ‘Proceed to deployment - but with a few conditions’ or ‘Not ready – requires rework on X’. This recommendation will feed into the governance decision-making in the next phase.
### Deployment (Release & Integration)
**Focus**   
This phase involves the release of the AI system into the live environment and its integration into the broader business or service workflow. Even after thorough pre-release testing, deployment can reveal new issues, so this stage includes final integration testing and checks in the production setting . 
Key activities: verify that the AI service is correctly interfacing with production data sources, databases, or other IT systems (e.g. does the API call from the web application correctly reach the AI model and handle responses?). Ensure all configuration is correct for prod (sometimes models behave differently if run on different hardware or with scaled loads, so do a sanity check in situ). Security hardening is finalized: confirm that any secrets, keys, or access controls for the AI in production are set as per security policy. There is also a governance aspect: before go-live, ensure all necessary approvals have been obtained (for high-risk AI, perhaps a formal sign-off by a senior responsible owner or an ethics board). Tech Documentation should be finalised. Essentially, the Deployment phase is about carefully rolling the AI out and making sure ‘everything is green’ in the live environment.  
**Example Outputs/Metrics**   
- Integration Test Results (Production): - Results of final integration tests run in the production environment or staging environment identical to production . This could include tests of end-to-end user journeys. For example: ‘Full workflow test (user submits application -> AI risk scoring -> database update -> user notified) passed all steps; data flows and hand-offs confirmed’. If any integration bugs were found (e.g. data format mismatches between systems), those are resolved or documented.
- Production Performance Metrics: - Baseline metrics collected with the system running under production load (or simulated load). E.g. ‘Average latency of AI API calls in production = 850ms, p95 latency = 1.3s, within acceptable range’. Throughput might be measured during a load test: ‘System can handle 50 requests per second with <5% error rate’. These numbers confirm that the system meets performance requirements in the real setup .
- Deployment Checklist Completion: - A completed checklist indicating all necessary deployment steps were done. For instance: ‘Model artifact hashed and archived; config files updated; monitoring alerts set up (yes/no); security review sign-off obtained (yes); ATRS transparency record published (yes)’. This ensures nothing is missed (like forgetting to start the monitoring service or failing to inform support teams).
- Final Approval Records: - Documentation of governance approval for go-live. This might be meeting minutes or a form signed by a relevant group. Essentially a record that due diligence was done and accountability is taken for deploying the AI.
### Monitoring & Continuous Assurance
**Focus**   
The lifecycle doesn’t end at deployment - continuous monitoring and improvement is crucial. In this operational phase, the AI system is live and delivering services, so the goal is to ensure it continues to perform as intended and to catch any issues early. The team should establish ongoing monitoring of key metrics - both technical (performance, error rates) and outcome-based (accuracy on new data, signs of bias drift). There should be alerts set for anomalous behavior, e.g. if the model’s predictions start significantly deviating from historical patterns or if input data characteristics shift beyond the training range . Additionally, periodic evaluations or audits are conducted: for example, retraining the model at scheduled intervals and re-running the full test suite, or annually auditing the AI for compliance and performance (some agencies might require an annual ‘AI health check’ to verify everything is still in order). Maintenance processes are also enacted here: if the business process changes or new data becomes available, the AI might need to be updated - any such changes should go through a controlled process (with re-testing before redeployment, per change management guidelines). In summary, this phase is about operational assurance - keeping the AI system reliable, efficient, and fair over time in the face of evolving conditions. 

**Example Outputs/Metrics**   
- Real-Time Performance & Drift Metrics: - Continuous metrics such as latency and throughput in production (monitored on dashboards), plus data drift and model drift indicators . For instance: a data drift metric might be the statistical distance between recent input data distribution and the training data distribution (alert if exceeds threshold), a model drift metric might compare model predictions now vs. a baseline (alert if e.g. the acceptance rate changes by more than X%). Also track system uptime and any failure incidents (downtime or error count).
- Incident Reports: - If any issues occur (e.g. the model made a significant error or the system was unavailable for a period), document each incident and the response. Metrics here include the number of incidents per month/quarter and mean time to detection and resolution. For example: ‘3 minor incidents in the last quarter (1 data pipeline outage for 2 hours, 2 cases of incorrect outputs flagged by users); all resolved within SLA; no major incidents’. This provides transparency and learning opportunities.
- Regular Re-testing and Audits: - The team might schedule something like quarterly regression tests on the AI. Metric example: ‘100% of test suite re-run after each monthly model update, with 98% pass rate (2% known non-critical issues under review)’. Or an annual audit might produce a compliance scorecard: e.g. ‘Yearly audit on 01/2026 reconfirmed model meets fairness requirements (differences within 2%), documentation updated, no new risks identified’. Essentially, treat it as if each major update or time period the AI needs to re-earn its safety badge.
- Model Refresh Frequency: - How often the model is updated/retrained with new data, and whether it’s keeping up with reality. If, say, the procedure is ‘retrain model every 3 months’, measure adherence: e.g. ‘Model version 1.3 deployed after Q1 retraining, achieved +2% accuracy improvement; next retrain scheduled Q2’ . If concept drift is faster than expected, frequency might increase. Conversely, measure if frequent changes are causing any regression, etc.
- End-of-Life Planning (Retirement): - Eventually, the AI system may be retired or replaced. As part of continuous improvement, there should be a plan for decommissioning when appropriate. Metrics or checks include ensuring data retention and deletion policies are followed (‘100% of personal data archived or deleted as per policy upon retirement’) , and lessons learned compiled for future projects. While this is the final step of the lifecycle, it’s noted here for completeness: successful retirement is also part of assuring the AI’s overall lifecycle (no loose ends or forgotten models left running).
